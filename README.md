# 🧠 BrainFood (Wlaz Ecosystem)

> **"Don't shop for recipes. Cook with what matches your backpack."**

## 🚀 The Vision
BrainFood is not just another recipe app. It's an intelligent kitchen assistant that reverses the traditional cooking flow. Instead of asking "What do you want to eat?" and sending you to the store, BrainFood asks **"What do you have?"** and shows you what you can create *right now*.

Part of the **Wlaz Ecosystem**, BrainFood aims to reduce food waste, save money, and eliminate the daily decision fatigue of "What's for dinner?".

## 💎 Key Features
- **The "Backpack" (Inventory)**: A gamified, visual inventory system. Add ingredients you own, organize them by category (e.g., Proteins, Veggies, Spices).
- **Reverse Recipe Search**: An intelligent algorithm that matches recipes to your inventory.
    - **100% Match**: Cook immediately.
    - ** Almost There (80%)**: You're missing 1-2 items.
    - **Smart Substitutions**: "No Lemon? Use Vinegar." (The 'Special Sauce' 🧪).
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Blazing fast performance. Your "Backpack" lives on your device. Syncs quietly when online.
- **Wlaz Integration**: Seamlessly connects with the Wlaz ecosystem (Brish).

## 🛠 Tech Stack Options (To Be Decided)
We are currently deciding between two powerful paths for the Android App:
1.  **Flutter**: For a "Glassmorphism" UI that pushes visual boundaries and potential iOS support.
2.  **Kotlin (Jetpack Compose)**: For deep Android integration and performance.

## 📅 Development Roadmap
See `task.md` for the detailed checklist.
1.  **Phase 1: The Foundation** - Database Schema & Basic UI.
2.  **Phase 2: The Logic** - Matching Algorithms & Substitution Graph.
3.  **Phase 3: The Polish** - Animations, "Chef" Character, Themes.
4.  **Phase 4: Launch** - Testing & Deployment.
